# QCxMS2-data
This archive contains the data of spectra calculations with QCxMS2 for the respective [publication]( DUMMY).
Each directory contains the input coordinates in.xyz, the experimental data exp.csv,QCxMS2 computed spectra at different levels of theory with default settings and rounded to integer m/z values:
-GFN2-xTB energies on geometries: gfn2_gfn2_qcxms2.csv
-wB97X-3c energies on GFN2-xTB geometries: wb97x3c_gfn2_qcxms2.csv
-wB97X-3c energies on wB97X-3c geometries: wb97x3c_wb97x3c_qcxms2.csv
and QCxMS computed spectra with GFN2-xTB rounded to integer m/z values: gfn2_qcxms.csv
